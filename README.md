# castor

Castor is a raycasting 3D game engine designed to stay out of your way as much as possible. It uses SDL for rendering so any SDL library is compatible with castor.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/KDesp73/castor
cd castor

# 2. Build castor and the demo
make all

> [!NOTE]
> Before `make all` the `check_deps.sh` script is run. In the case that a 
> dependency is missing add it to your system
