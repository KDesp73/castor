# Story

## The "Glitch" as a Mechanic

Unstable Reality: Occasionally, parts of the environment start flickering between normal and a wireframe-like state, revealing the artificial nature of the world.
Glitch Mode Activation: The player can trigger a "glitch mode" manually (e.g., by using a special artifact) to remove textures from walls, exposing hidden paths or secrets.
Corrupted Vision: Some monsters might appear normal but in glitch mode, their true horrifying form is revealed.

## The "Glitch" as a Storytelling Tool

Breaking the Fourth Wall: The character starts realizing the world isn’t real—maybe they see developer messages hidden behind textures or hear distorted audio of someone speaking in a different dimension.
NPCs React to Glitches: Some NPCs might acknowledge the glitches, while others pretend nothing is wrong, adding to the mystery.
False Memories: As the game progresses, the world’s logic starts breaking down, and the character remembers things from the "real world" that don't belong.

## The "Glitch" as a Horror Element

Enemies Corrupting the World: Some creatures might spread the glitch, causing the environment around them to dissolve.
Glitch-Based Enemies: Some monsters might only be visible when the world glitches, forcing the player to use the mechanic strategically.
Reality Warping: The level itself might change when glitching—doors disappear, walls shift, or the entire room collapses into an empty void.

## The "Glitch" as a Puzzle Mechanic

Seeing Through Walls: Some walls might be fake, but only when textures are removed.
Distorted Maps: A map might look normal, but in the glitched world, new paths or symbols appear.
Scrambled Text: Books, notes, or inscriptions might have missing words that only appear in glitch mode.

## Meta Narrative Possibilities

Player vs. System: Maybe an unknown entity is trying to keep the character inside the simulation, and every glitch brings them closer to escape.
Multiple Endings: If the player embraces the glitches, they might discover a way to exit the simulation. If they ignore them, they might be doomed to repeat the cycle.
A Hidden Overseer: Perhaps the game world has an unseen "developer" who occasionally "patches" the world, closing glitches the player discovers.
